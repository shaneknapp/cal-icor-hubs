# Phase 1 (canary) of the public-to-private node migration: the private
# replacement for the existing public prometheus-pool-2025-12-22.
#
# Lowest-risk pool to move first — zero user impact (a metrics gap at worst), but
# stateful enough (the 1000Gi prometheus-data PD must reattach) to prove the full
# private path: Cloud NAT egress, Private Google Access, and PD reattachment.
#
# State key derives from this path: "spring-2025/prometheus-pool". The directory
# is role-named, not date-stamped, so it stays stable across future recreations;
# the date-stamped pool NAME lives in inputs below.
#
# Parity with the live prometheus-pool-2025-12-22 (describe 2026-06-28); the
# module defaults carry the shared config, so inputs here are only the
# prometheus-specific values plus the two migration deltas (private + name).
