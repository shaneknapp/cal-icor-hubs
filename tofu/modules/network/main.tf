# Outbound egress for the cluster's private nodes.
#
# This file creates only the outbound path. It does not touch the inbound ingress
# IP 34.56.76.244 (reserved address wildcard-dns-target-spring-2025, pinned to the
# ingress-nginx LoadBalancer via support/values.yaml loadBalancerIP, resolved by
# the Infoblox wildcard *.jupyter.cal-icor.org). That ingress IP and the NAT
# egress IP below are separate addresses for opposite directions.

# Reserved static egress IP. Stable, known source address for all private-node
# traffic leaving for the public internet (quay.io, ghcr.io, Docker Hub, PyPI,
# conda, apt, ACME). Reserved (not AUTO) so it can be documented and allowlisted
# downstream the same way the inbound IP is.
