Contains a fully reproducible configuration for JupyterHub for the Cal ICOR deployments.

[Cal ICOR](https://cal-icor.org)

In partnership with [UC Berkeley CDSS](https://cdss.berkeley.edu) and the
[California Learning Lab](https://calearninglab.org/).

This repository contains the Helm chart and configuration files for
deploying JupyterHub on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using
[Zero to JupyterHub](https://z2jh.jupyter.org/). It is designed to be
reproducible and easy to use, allowing users to quickly set up and
configure JupyterHub for their needs.

This deployment is based on the [UC Berkeley DataHub](https://github.com/berkeley-dsep/datahub)
deployment, which is a JupyterHub deployment used by UC Berkeley students,
faculty, and staff.

## Single-user server images

All user images are located in their own repositories located in the
[Cal ICOR repo](https://github.com/cal-icor).  You can
find them either by [searching there](https://github.com/orgs/cal-icor/repositories?language=&q=image&sort=&type=all)
or from links in the deployment's `image/README.md`.

We currently use three single-user server images, but
[calicor/base-user-image](https://github.com/cal-icor/base-user-image) and
[calicor/csumb-user-image](https://github.com/cal-icor/csumb-user-image) are
live for students/instructors. These images are very similar, but the latter
has additional conda environments for specific classes.

The third user image is for workshops,
[calicor/workshop-user-image](https://github.com/cal-icor/workshop-user-image).
This is for workshops, and has a bunch of AI packages installed.

## Branches

The `staging` branch always reflects the state of the [staging JupyterHub](https://staging.jupyter.cal-icor.org),
and the `prod` branch reflects the state of the [production JupyterHub](https://jupyter.cal-icor.org).

## Setting up your fork and clones

First, go to your [github profile settings](https://github.com/settings/keys)
and make sure you have an SSH key uploaded.

Next, go to the [Cal ICOR hubs github repo](https://github.com/cal-icor/cal-icor-hubs/)
and create a fork.  To do this, click on the `fork` button and then `Create fork`.

Now clone this repo on your local device.  You can get the URL to do
this by clicking on the green `Code` button in the `cal-icor-hubs` repo (*not* your fork)
and clicking on `ssh`:

``` bash
git clone git@github.com:cal-icor/cal-icor-hubs.git
```

Now `cd` in to `cal-icor-hubs` and set up your local repo to point both at the primary
Jupyterhub repo (`upstream`) and your fork (`origin`).  After the initial clone,
`origin` will be pointing to the main repo and we'll need to change that.

``` bash
$ cd cal-icor-hubs
$ git remote -v
origin  git@github.com:cal-icor/cal-icor-hubs.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:cal-icor/cal-icor-hubs.git (push)
$ git remote rename origin upstream
$ git remote add origin git@github.com:<your github username>/cal-icor-hubs.git
$ git remote -v
origin  git@github.com:<your github username>/cal-icor-hubs.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:<your github username>/cal-icor-hubs.git (push)
upstream    git@github.com:cal-icor/cal-icor-hubs.git (fetch)
upstream    git@github.com:cal-icor/cal-icor-hubs.git (push)
```

Now you can sync your local repo from `upstream`, and push those changes to your
fork (`origin`):

``` bash
git checkout staging && \
git fetch --prune --all && \
git rebase upstream/staging && \
git push origin staging
```

## Installing the required python packages for working with this repo

In the root directory of this repo, install `dev-requirements.txt` with the
following command:  `pip install -r dev-requirements.txt`.  This will install
the base python packages that are required to perform the tasks associated with
editing, testing, building and deploying hubs.

The other python package definition file, `requirements.txt` is used solely by
our Github Actions CI/CD pipeline.

## Installing other software packages required to deploy infrastructure

Our GKE infrastructure is managed with [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/) and
orchestrated by [Terragrunt](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/).

### Installing OpenTofu

For macOS:

``` bash
brew update
brew install opentofu
```

For Debian/Ubuntu flavors of linux:

``` bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -fsSL https://get.opentofu.org/install-opentofu.sh | bash
```

### Installing Terragrunt

For macOS, Linux:

``` bash
curl -sSfL --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://terragrunt.com/install | bash
```

## Pre-Commit hooks: Installing

The previous step, `pip install -r dev-requirements.txt`, installs the package
[`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/). This is used to run a series of
commands defined in the file [`.pre-commit-config.yaml`](https://github.com/cal-icor/cal-icor-hubs/blob/staging/.pre-commit-config.yaml)
to help ensure no mistakes are committed to the repo.

After you've installed `dev-requirements.txt`, execute the following two
commands:

``` bash
pre-commit install
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Procedure

When developing for this deployment, always work in a fork of this repo.
You should also make sure that your repo is up-to-date with this one prior
to making changes. This is because other contributors may have pushed changes
after you last synced with this repo but before you upstreamed your changes.

### Syncing your repo

The following commands will sync the local clone of your fork with `upstream`:

``` bash
git checkout staging && \
git fetch --prune --all && \
git rebase upstream/staging && \
git push origin staging
```

### Creating a feature branch

To create a new feature branch and switch to it, run the following command:

``` bash
git checkout -b <branch name>
```

### Checking the status and diffs of your local work

After you make your changes, you can use the following commands to see
what's been modified and check out the diffs:  `git status` and `git diff`.

### Adding, committing and pushing changes

When you're ready to push these changes, first you'll need to stage them for a
commit:

``` bash
git add <file1> <file2> <etc>
```

Commit these changes locally:

``` bash
git commit -m "some pithy commit description"
```

Now push to your fork:

``` bash
git push origin <branch name>
```

### Creating a pull request

Once you've pushed to your fork, you can go to the
[Cal-ICOR hubs repo](https://github.com/cal-icor/cal-icor-hubs) and there
should be a big green button on the top that says `Compare and pull request`.
Click on that, check out the commits and file diffs, edit the title and
description if needed and then click `Create pull request`.

If you're having issues, you can refer to the [github documentation for pull
requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).
The choice for `base` in the GitHub PR user interface should be the staging
branch of this repo while the choice for `head` is your fork.

Once this is complete and if there are no problems, you can request that
someone review the PR before merging, or you can merge yourself if you are
confident. This merge will trigger a Github Actions workflow which upgrades the
helm deployment on the staging site. When this is complete, test your
changes there. For example if you updated a library, make sure that a new
user server instance has the new version. If you spot any problems you can
revert your change. You should test the changes soon after the merge since
we do not want unverified changes to linger in staging.

If staging fails, *never* update production. Revert your change or
call in help if necessary. If your change is successful, you will need
to merge the change from staging branch to production. Create another PR,
this time with the `base` set to prod and the `head` set to staging. This
PR will trigger a similar Travis process. Test your change on production
for good measure.

## Service Accounts: cloudbank-pilot-hub-users

The [`cloudbank-pilot-hub-users`](https://github.com/cal-icor/cloudbank-pilot-hub-users)
repo runs a nightly dashboard job that queries each Cal-ICOR hub's
`/hub/api/users` endpoint to report the number of users per hub for reporting
purposes. Under JupyterHub 5.x, an API token can't list users unless it's
explicitly granted the scopes to do so, so each hub defines a read-only service account, `cloudbank-pilot-hub-users`, for this purpose.

The dashboard only ever queries **production** hubs, so this service account
only needs to exist in each hub's `prod` config/secrets — it is not set up for `staging`.

### The role stanza

Each hub's `deployments/<hub>/config/prod.yaml` defines a `loadRoles` entry
granting the `cloudbank-pilot-hub-users` service `list:users` and `read:users` scopes:

``` yaml
jupyterhub:
  hub:
    loadRoles:
      cloudbank-pilot-hub-users:
        services:
          - cloudbank-pilot-hub-users
        scopes:
          - list:users
          - read:users
```

If a hub's `prod.yaml` doesn't define this role and stanza, its `prod` config
should be updated to include one when the service account is added or its
tokens rotated.

### The per-hub token

Each hub also defines a **unique** SOPS-encrypted API token for the service,
in `deployments/<hub>/secrets/prod.yaml`:

``` yaml
jupyterhub:
  hub:
    services:
      cloudbank-pilot-hub-users:
        apiToken: <unique per-hub token>
```

### Generating and setting a token

This is automatically generated when deploying a new hub with
`create_deployment.sh`. If you need to generate one manually, please run the
following command and update that deployment's `secrets/prod.yaml`.

``` bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

### Keeping it in sync with cloudbank-pilot-hub-users

The dashboard authenticates using these same tokens, so whenever a hub's token
is created here, the **same value** must also be updated in the
`cloudbank-pilot-hub-users` repo's `enc-pilots.json`, in the `token` field of
the pilot entry matching this hub (matched by `url`, where `where: icor`).

You can get the generated token to put in `enc-pilots.json` by running:

``` bash
sops -d --extract '["jupyterhub"]["hub"]["services"]["cloudbank-pilot-hub-users"]["apiToken"]' \
  deployments/<hub>/secrets/prod.yaml
```

`sops` prints the token without a trailing newline, so zsh appends a `%` to the
line. It is not part of the token.

If the two repos' tokens drift, the dashboard will get a `403` /
`Missing or invalid credentials` error querying that hub until they're
brought back in sync.

## SSL: LetsEncrypt Strategy

The Berkeley-based SPA email address, <cal-icor-support@berkeley.edu>, is the
contact email used to create the SSL certificate for the Cal-ICOR hubs at
[LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/). The address is only used by LetsEncrypt
when there is a problem renewing the certificate.
